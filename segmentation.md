## segmentations:-------in networking
Network segmentation is the practice of dividing a network* into smaller, isolated sections. These partitions can be created and secured via physical hardware or software, each of which come with their own implementation challenges.

By cordoning off different segments of a network, organizations can more easily prevent lateral movement, exert granular control over network traffic, and improve network performance. They may even set policies for individual workloads and applications, an approach known as microsegmentation.

*A network is a group of computers that are connected to each other.



- **w does network segmentation work?**
Network segmentation divides a network into multiple sections, to which different controls can then be applied. Typically, this process is performed using one of two methods: physical segmentation and logical segmentation.

Physical segmentation
Physical segmentation requires hardware appliances — like routers, switches, and firewalls — to separate a network into discrete sections. These appliances control the type of traffic that is allowed to enter and exit each section via segmentation policies, which can be configured according to specific criteria (e.g. traffic source, destination, and so on).

Physical segmentation (also called perimeter-based segmentation) is often expensive and labor-intensive to set up and maintain. It also operates under the assumption that most organizations still maintain a physical network perimeter.

With the advent of cloud computing, however, this perimeter has all but disappeared, as users can access data and applications over the Internet, rather than internal, IT-managed networks. Even organizations that use on-premises infrastructure often allow users to connect to internal resources from external devices and software.
