# How Your Server and Web Server (Nginx/Apache) Work

## Overview
This explains how your server and web server (Nginx or Apache) manage requests from users trying to access your website.

## Your Server
This is where your website (webpage files) is hosted. It could be a computer or a cloud service where your website’s files are stored.

### Nginx or Apache on Your Server
These web servers sit on your server and manage requests from users who want to access your website.

## How It Works When a User Requests Your Webpage

1. A user types your website's URL into their browser (e.g., `www.yourwebsite.com`).
2. That request reaches your server through the internet.
3. **Nginx** or **Apache** then:
   - Receives this request.
   - Finds the webpage file on your server (HTML, CSS, etc.).
   - Transfers and delivers the webpage to the user’s browser.
4. The browser on the user’s device then displays your webpage.

### Example
Let’s say you built a webpage on your server. When someone from another location tries to access it, **Nginx** or **Apache** will take your webpage from your server and deliver it to the user's browser.

### In Short
**Nginx** or **Apache** are responsible for taking the webpage stored on your server and sending it to the user's browser when someone tries to access your website from the internet.
